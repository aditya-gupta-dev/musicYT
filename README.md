# Music YT

A web application that uses youtube's data API as a music player.

## Why I build this ?

I identified a problem that some songs were not available on spotify & on youtube you can listen to these songs but constantly hearing ads gets annoying on both platforms & they take a lot of RAM in the background. 

## Solution
I used youtube's data API and Pytube to stream the audio format on my website. Hence a music player.
